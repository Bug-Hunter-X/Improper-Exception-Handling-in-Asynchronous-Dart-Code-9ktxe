# Improper Exception Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart programming: neglecting to gracefully handle exceptions in asynchronous operations. The `bug.dart` file contains the flawed code. The solution demonstrates proper error handling using `try-catch` blocks and returning appropriate values to indicate success or failure.

## Bug

The original code lacks comprehensive exception handling, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior if the API request fails.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides an improved version with better error handling that ensures program stability even if errors occur. The solution returns a `Result` class representing either success or failure.
